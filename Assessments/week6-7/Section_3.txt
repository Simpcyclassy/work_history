In this assessment, you will use will be tested on your knowledge of javascript
concepts from Section 3 of the video lectures. Answer them in YOUR OWN WORDS.
Feel free to provide examples to help illustrate your train of thought.

1. Javascript is a dynamically typed language. What does this mean?

It means that javaScript is able to read and identify the data type assigned to a variable during execution without being stated with a keyword like in some other languages.

2. What is a primitive type? Explain each primitive type.

It is a data type that represents a single value, these does not include objects but can be converted to objects apart from 'undefined' and 'null'. They include;

undefined: A type which has no value assigned to its variable.

boolean: A logical entity with two values; true and false.

null: It is used to represent an intentional absence of any value.

number: It is the numeric type in javaScript.

string: It is the type that is used to represent text kind of data. It is surrounded by quotation marks ('' or "").

symbol: It is a data type used when the property is intended to be private.

3. What are operators and operands?

Operators are special functions written in between values that allow different operations like addition, multiplication, equality etc.

Operands are the codes that surround the operator which it performs operation on.

eg
const a = 22 * 5;

* is an operator while,
22 and 5 are the operands.

4. In what order does operators get called?
Operators are called in order of operator precedence (whereby the higher precedence overwrites the lower precedence) and could be called from left-to-right or right-to-left according to its associativity.

eg
const a = 100 - 360 / 200;
//returns 98.2
This is because by operator precedence, division is higher than subtraction

console.log(54 < 68 < 31);
//returns true based on associativity

5. What does it mean when a value is coerced?

It means that the data type of a variable has been dynamically changed during comparison.

let a = '68', b = 54;

console.log(a + b);
//returns 6854
This is because 54 was coerced to a string.

6. What is the difference between '==' and '==='?

'==' checks if two values are equal.

'===' checks if two values are strictly equal.

let a = 31;

let b = '31';

console.log(a == b);
//returns true

console.log(a === b);
//returns false
